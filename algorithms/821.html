// Input: s = "loveleetcode", c = "e"
// Output: [3,2,1,0,1,0,0,1,2,2,1,0]
// Explanation: The character 'e' appears at indices 3, 5, 6, and 11 (0-indexed).
// The closest occurrence of 'e' for index 0 is at index 3, so the distance is abs(0 - 3) = 3.
// The closest occurrence of 'e' for index 1 is at index 3, so the distance is abs(1 - 3) = 2.
//The closest occurrence of 'e' for index 2  is at index 3,  so the distance is abs(2 - 3) = 1.
// For index 4, there is a tie between the 'e' at index 3 and the 'e' at index 5, but the distance is still the same: abs(4 - 3) == abs(4 - 5) = 1.
// The closest occurrence of 'e' for index 8 is at index 6, so the distance is abs(8 - 6) = 2.

// Input: s = "aaab", c = "b"
// 1) find the value of c in s as index  -> index  3
// 2) loop answer's index one by one 
// ex) the closest occurence of the c's value for index 0 in answer is 3 
// 3) check what is the closest occurrence of the c's value for each index 
// 4) calculate the distance : abs(answer's - the closest index)
// Output: [3,2,1,0]
